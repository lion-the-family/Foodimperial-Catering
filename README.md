## Description

### Motivation

It's an example of static html website in my performance. 
This page are the main [here][foodimperial]. 

### History

I developed several joomla templates for this company
and it's the part of my work which is related to front-end.

### Features
- ⭐ The html is valid, semantic and accessible.
- ⭐ The sass styles is incapsulated to the separate modules for better supporting.
- ⭐ Implement adaptive design.
- ⭐ All client logic is developed on native javascript with using ES6 and new features from ES7-ES10.
- ⭐ The gulp build configuration is also self-made. I had been developing and improving it for similar
projects until I switched to webpack.
